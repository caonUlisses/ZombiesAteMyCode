Keeping an (active) record of infected people and helping with some trades.

## Help us survive

The world ended, but good practices are still a thing. :pray:
Our domain is pretty simple, so shall be our code!

For those who want to contribute, follow below:

### Keep the models safe!

This is a goold-old boring rails app, following the moto **'Fat models, skinny controllers'**.
Zombies like some meat, so by keeping the outer layer (controllers) skinny, we keep our fat models safe.

#### But they can't run!!!1!

Whenever a model gets too fat, break it down (don't you dare just moving some methods to a module).
Do so by extracting value and service objects.
Our time is nye, so don't over over-engineer.

## See it live!
